# Hotdogs

**Let\'s just say, hypothetically, you needed exactly 141 photos of hotdogs.**

In 224x224 resoloution, to be specific.

Likely not all of these are hotdogs, I just scraped google search results. Feel free to add hotdogs of your own, and remove non-hotdog items. All of these are under the creative commons liscence, so you can do whatever you want with them. Train a machine learning model, or simply admire them. 

**I won\'t ask questions. Just take them, and get out.**

Also includes a hotdog downloader, incase you wanna start your own collection!

**Last, but most certanly not least, here's the OAuth to add a hotdog bot to your own discord server!**

[Oauth](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=909941201065611274&permissions=0&scope=bot)

**Future plans for this repo:**

I'll put any of my projects that involve the hotdog dataset here, including some upcoming ML work.

**Enjoy!**
